Valuation of real estate
 
 ## Current state
Currently this is an unnused dateset, which I am not happy with. To do what I consider a good job, I would need past date, square feet, and a lot of other infor.  

Maybe I will circle back to this project idea if I need it for a data mining course. Right now im focusing on Biologically Plausible ML & (complex) Bayesian models
